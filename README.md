# Inventory App Project

Ninth Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

The goal was to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products.
The app needed to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product.
It also needed to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.
